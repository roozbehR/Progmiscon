## String Pool in Java üöÄ

String pool in java is a pool of strings sorted on java heap memory.
First let's look at the ways we can make a string in java. Consider the following:

- Using the "new" operator

```
String s1 = new String("Hello");
```

- Using string literals

```
String s1 = "Hello";
```

Which one uses a string pool? String literals use the Java string pool.

How does it work? When we use a string literal in java, JVM checks if that string exists in the string pool. If it does, it returns a reference to it. Otherwise, it allocates memory for it, puts it in the pool, and returns a reference.

</h2>

Benefits: Memory allocation and creating a string are costly operations. It is possible to just use "==" instead of equals in Java to compare the strings.

Note: Making strings using the "new" operator creates a new string everytime on heap no matter if that already exists on the heap or not.

## Aliases in Programming üöÄ

Aliases in programming is when 2 or more references refer to the same object. Alias in programming is considered a bad practice and it is shown to be very error prone.

<h2 align="center">
  <img src="./Images/aliasing.png" alt="Gatsby Simplefolio" width="100%">
</h2>

why is aliasing in programming error prone and a bad practice? The reason is the programmer at some point might change the state of the object. In that case, the other owners of the object might not be aware of the change. Hence, when used they might cause a problem.

Use cases of aliasing:
Aliases are useful when the objects that you work with are immutable such as strings in Java or integers in python. An example is string literals in Java. One or more refrences can refer to the same string.

How does Java handle polymorphism and aliasing?

Please consider the following code snippet:

```
class A {
	public void methodParent() {
		System.out.println("method in Parent");
	}
}

class B extends A {
	public void methodParent() {
		System.out.println("override method in Child");
	}

	public void methodChild() {
		System.out.println("method in Child");
	}
}

public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		B[] b = new B[10];
		A[] a = b;

		a[0] =  new A();
		b[0].methodParent();
	}
}
```

Now consider following scenario:

```
public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		B[] b = new B[10];
		A[] a = b;

		a[0] =  new A();
		b[0].methodParent();
	}
}
```

This is what it looks like for refrences "a" and "b" in memory:

<h2 align="center">
  <img src="./Images/JavaAliasing.jpeg" alt="Gatsby Simplefolio" width="100%">
</h2>

Explanation of the code:

We have aliases "a" and "b". After running the code snippet we will get:

```
Exception in thread ‚Äúmain‚Äù java.lang.ArrayStoreException: aliasingtest.A
at aliasingtest.Main.main(Main.java:26)
```

The reason is becasue Java handles aliases during run-time. It is during run-time that it understands
first element should be a B object, instead of A.

To correc the code snippet we should write it as following:

```
B[] b = new B[10];
A[] a = b;

a[0] =  new B();
b[0].methodParent();
```

which produces the following output:

```
override method in Child
```

## Interning in Programming üöÄ

Interning means that there is only one copy of a distinct string on the heap. Meaning that if you have two variables that point to a string of the same value, both of them are referring to the same memory address. Basically, interning in short means a process of storing only one copy of each distinct string value in memory.

why is aliasing in programming error prone and a bad practice? The reason is the programmer at some point might change the state of the object. In that case, the other owners of the object might not be aware of the change. Hence, when used they might cause a problem.

Use cases of aliasing:

Interning is used because memory allocation is a costly operation.

Notes: Objects other than string can also be interned. Only immutable objects can be interned.

## Overloading Operators üöÄ

What does it mean to overload an operator? It means to give an operator meaning beyond what its predefined operational meaning.

Perhaps giving an example will help you to understand more. Please pay attention to the following example:

Consider the + operator in python. It is used to add integers. It is used to merge lists. It is used to concatenate strings and‚Ä¶, you get the point. What if we want to give more abilities to this operator such that it will work on some object let's call it Point? Consider the code snippet below:

```
class Point:
    def __init__(self, x=0, y=0):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
p1 = Point(1, 2)
p2 = Point(2, 3)
print(p1+p2) (**)
```

If we run this code we get the following output/error:

```
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'Point' and 'Point'
```

This means that the + operand still does not know how to add these two objects. In other terms it is not defined for + operator to add two points on the cartesian plane.

In order for + operator to add to cordinates we have to update the class point by defining **add** method in that class. In other words, we are overloading the + operator.

Before we continue, keep the following note in mind:
Every operator has a special magic method associated with it. For example, when we use + what it does is that it dispatches and calls the magic method **add**. And basically this method does the job for us. Now, for every custom object we define this magic method inside that class. This is how we overload the operators and give them the knowledge how to operate on different objects. Now I am going to overload the + operator to be able to operate on Point objects:

Now consider the following code snippet:

```
class Point:
    def __init__(self, x=0, y=0):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y

    def __str__(self):
        return "({0},{1})".format(self.x, self.y)

    def __add__(self, other):
        x = self.x + other.x
        y = self.y + other.y
        return Point(x, y)

```

If we run the following code:

```
p1 = Point(1, 2)
p2 = Point(2, 3)
print(p1+p2)

```

We get the following output:

```
# (3, 5)
```

Note: Every operator has a mafic method associated with it. Example:

```
Addition   p1 + p2  p1.__add__(p2)


Subtraction   p1 - p2  p1.__sub__(p2)


Multiplication    p1 * p2  p1.__mul__(p2)


Bitwise AND   p1 & p2   p1.__and__(p2)


Remainder (modulo)    p1 % p2   p1.__mod__(p2)


```

## Statement VS. Expression üöÄ

In rough words, expression is a line of code that can be evaluated to a value which can be used later in the program. On the other hand, a statement is a line of code that performs an action for us or makes an impact in the program.

To be more formal we define expression to be:

Some examples of expressions are following:

```
aChar = 'S'

"Hello Worl" + "d"

Character.isUpperCase(aChar)

```

An expression is a series of variables, operators, and method calls (constructed according to the syntax of the language) that evaluates to a single value.

Statements are roughly equivalent to sentences in natural languages. A statement forms a complete unit of execution. The following types of expressions can be made into a statement by terminating the expression with a semicolon (;):

- Assignment expressions
- Any use of ++ or --
- Method calls
- Object creation expressions

We have three types of statements:

- Expression statements : When you terminate an expression with ";"
- Declaration statements : When you declare a variable
- Control flow statements : Used to execute statements conditionally, repeatedly, and etc.

## Instructions:

### Step 1 - STRUCTURE

Go to `/src/mock/data.js` and fill your information, they are 5 objects:

### Hero Section

```javascript
export const heroData = {
  title: "", // Hello, my name is
  name: "", // John
  subtitle: "", // I'm the Unknown Developer.
  cta: "", // Know more
};
```

### About Section

**_Important Note_**: All the images must live inside the `src/images/` folder in order for Gatsby to show the images correctly.

```javascript
export const aboutData = {
  img: "profile.jpg", // put your profile image (recommended aspect radio: square)
  paragraphOne: "",
  paragraphTwo: "",
  paragraphThree: "",
  resume: "https://www.resumemaker.online/es.php", // if no resume, the button will not show up
};
```

### Projects Section

**_Important Note_**: All the images must live inside the `src/images/` folder in order for Gatsby to show the images correctly.

Put as many projects object you want inside the `array`.

```javascript
export const projectsData = [
  {
    id: nanoid(),
    img: 'project.jpg',
    title: '',
    info: '',
    info2: '',
    url: '',
    repo: 'https://github.com/cobidev/react-simplefolio', // if no repo, the button will not show up
  },
  {
    id: nanoid(),
    img: 'project.jpg',
    title: '',
    info: '',
    info2: '',
    url: '',
    repo: 'https://github.com/cobidev/react-simplefolio', // if no repo, the button will not show up
  },
  ...
];
```

### Contact Section

```javascript
export const contactData = {
  cta: "", // call to action text for the contact section
  btn: "", // text inside the button
  email: "",
};
```

### Footer Section

You can remove or add as many you social-media icons you want.\
Just put an object with the corresponding values inside the networks `array` or remove it from there.

```javascript
export const footerData = {
  networks: [
    {
      id: nanoid(),
      name: "twitter",
      url: "", // your twitter url
    },
    {
      id: nanoid(),
      name: "codepen",
      url: "", // your codepen url
    },
    {
      id: nanoid(),
      name: "linkedin",
      url: "", // your linkedin url
    },
    {
      id: nanoid(),
      name: "github",
      url: "", // your github url
    },
  ],
};
```

### Required - Disable GitHub buttons

Set `isEnabled` to `false` once you finish setup your portfolio.\
By setting to `false` it will hide the GitHub stars/fork buttons

```javascript
export const githubButtons = {
  isEnabled: true, // true is the default value
};
```

### Step 2 - STYLES

Change the color theme of the website ( choose 2 colors to create a gradient ):

Go to `src/styles/abstracts/_variables.scss` and only change the values on this classes `$main-color` and `$secondary-color` to your prefered HEX color

```scss
// Default values
$main-color: #02aab0;
$secondary-color: #00cdac;
```

**_Note_**: I highly recommend to checkout gradients variations on [UI Gradient](https://uigradients.com/#BrightVault)
